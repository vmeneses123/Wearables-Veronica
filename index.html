    <h1>Wearables Idea </h1>
    <p>
        My concept for my wearable is to create a transparent guitar pick that I can attach lights to so that when I play my guitar the pick will light up. I think my imput will be the motion of the pick but I am not sure what will work best yet. For the output, it would be the lights turning on and off. Maybe I could make the lights change color each time they turn on and off.
